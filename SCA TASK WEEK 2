Write a bash script that takes the file users.txt as input and prints out the average age of male and average age of female.

GENDER NAME AGE
M  Josh 25
F  Lucy 19
F  Grace 9
F  Princess 20
M  Job 50
M  Pete 33
F  Pauline 27


To output the average age of male and female i used a bash script called scascript and it has the following:

#!/bin/bash
output=users.txt
#This shows the content of  the users.txt file
cat $output
This shows the age of the users that are Male
grep 'M' users.txt

echo
This shows the age of the users that are Female
grep 'F' users.txt

echo

awk '{
        age[$1]+=$3  #accumulate  total age for this gender
        counter[$1]+=1  #increment  count of record for this gender female or male
        }
         END {
                for (gender in age)
                 {
                        print gender, age[gender], age[gender]/counter[gender]
                 }
                }' users.txt

To run the script i used 
./scascript 

I got an error about permission denied and i was able to resolve the error by
chmod u+x scascript

After performing this error i was able to run the script and it worked successfully
