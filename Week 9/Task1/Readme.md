# Automating a GCP SQL Database in a Private Subnet with Terraform

## Requirements
1. Google Cloud Platform(GCP) Project
2. GCP service account private key
3. Google Compute Engine
4. Terraform (for automating resource creation)

A GCP project can have up to five VPC networks, and each Compute Engine instance belongs to one VPC network. If interested in the Terraform [GCP provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html) docs or more generally about Terraform resources read [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html).

### Terraform Installation
1. Copy link address for [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) download
  ```
    $ wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.16/terraform_0.12.16_darwin_amd64.zip
    $ unzip terraform_0.12.16_darwin_amd64.zip
    $ mv terraform Downloads/
    $ vim ~/.profile
    Add `export PATH="$PATH:~/Downloads"` to ~/.profile
  ```
2. Verify installation: `$ terraform` or `$ terraform --version`
3. `$ mkdir -p ~/terraform/vpc`

### Google Cloud Platform
1. [Create project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) from GCP console
2. From the GCP main menu â˜° > Enable the Compute Engine API
3. Navigate to Credentials from the left panel and select **Create Credentials** > choose **Service account key** from the dropdown > **New service account**:
      + Choose a name and set role to **Editor**
      + **JSON** > **Create**
      + Now the private key will download to your local machine.
4. [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive) the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/). For Linux/Mac:

  ```
    $ curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
    $ exec -l $SHELL
    $ gcloud init
  ```
5. From `~/terraform/vpc`, create a Terraform config file, `main.tf`, with the following configuration:

      + **Note:** You will need to edit the values of the following argument names (credentials, project)

  ```
    provider "google" {
      credentials = file("<FILE_PATH>.json")         

      project = "<PROJECT_ID>"              
      region  = "us-west1"
      zone    = "us-west1-a"
    }
/This is for creation of vpc/
   resource "google_compute_network" "vpc" {
  name                    = "master-default-gw"
  routing_mode            = "GLOBAL"
  auto_create_subnetworks = true
}

resource "google_compute_global_address" "private_ip_block" {
  name         = "private-ip-block"
  purpose      = "VPC_PEERING"
  address_type = "INTERNAL"
  ip_version   = "IPV4"
  prefix_length = 20
  network       = google_compute_network.vpc.self_link
}

resource "google_service_networking_connection" "private_vpc_connection" {
  network       = google_compute_network.vpc.self_link
  service                 = "servicenetworking.googleapis.com"
  reserved_peering_ranges = [google_compute_global_address.private_ip_block.name]
}
  ```
6. To create the  SQL database with Terraform in a Private subnet copy the "db.tf" file

7. `$ terraform init`
    + You should now see `Terraform has been successfully initialized!`
8. `$ terraform apply` and enter 'yes' to continue.
    + You should now see `Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.`
    + From the GCP console you can see your newly created SQL instance, substituting <PROJECT_ID>: 
    `https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?project=<PROJECT_ID>`
