Write a bash script that takes the file users.txt as input and prints out the average age of male and average age of female.

To output the average age of male and female i used a bash script called users.sh ,it is added in this repository

To run the script i used 
./users.sh

I got an error about permission denied and i was able to resolve the error by
chmod u+x scascript

This gives me the write to be able to run the file as an executable file.

After resolving this error i was able to run the script and it worked successfully by showing the average of female and male
